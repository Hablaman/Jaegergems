A discord bot for a multiplayer pokemon-esque game

With the upload to github discord changed the token for the bot, but you need to make your own new token anyway.

The bot needs the save file jaegersave.pickle in the same directory to run, there are commands to clear the save file.
The side script runchecker.py does not need to run at the same time. It was supposed to restart the bot when it went down, but it did not always work.
